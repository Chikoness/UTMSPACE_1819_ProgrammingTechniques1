/** 
    __ITERATION__
    The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:

    - If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.  
    - If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.  
    - Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
    - Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)
