# UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1
My codes from my subject - Programming Techniques 1 (SCSJ1013) @ UTMSPACE (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia - School of Professional and Continuing Education). All codes are written in C programming language.

_Assignment 1 - 4 was done in DevC++, hence the .exe and .layout miscellanous files._

Algorithm
1. Start
2. Declare variables for counter and to store the formula of triangular number - i and triangularNumber
3. Print "Triangular Number: "
4. Start for loop with counter i = 5
5. If i <= 50, go to next step. Else, go to step 10
6. Calculate triangularNumber = i * (i + 1) / 2
7. Print the value of triangularNumber
8. Calculate counter i + 5
9. Go back to step 5
10. End
- [Question 6](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/blob/master/Extra_Assignment/Code_6.c) - ITERATION - The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows: If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop. If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop. Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R). Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R).
