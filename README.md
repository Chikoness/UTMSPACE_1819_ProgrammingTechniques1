# UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1
My codes from my subject - Programming Techniques 1 (SCSJ1013) @ UTMSPACE (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia - School of Professional and Continuing Education).

_Assignment 1 - 4 was done in DevC++, hence the .exe and .layout miscellanous files._

##### 1) [Assignment 1](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_1)
- [Question 1](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_1/Question_1) - Write a C program to compute the straight line distance between two points A (-2, -1) and B (4, 5) in a plane.
- [Question 2](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_1/Question_2) - Compute and display the cost of apples given the number of kilograms (kg) purchased and the prices per kilogram of apples.
- [Question 3](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_1/Question_3) - Calculate and display the volume of a cylinder.
- [Question 4](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_1/Question_4) - You are given the Height of the cylinder (h) and Radius of the cylinder base area (r). Write a C program to calculate and display all the cylinder parameters.

- [Question 3_2](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_2/Question_3_2) - Method 2: Using division and multiplication to find if a number is even or odd
- [Question 3_3](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_2/Question_3_3) - Method 3: Using repeated subtraction of 2 to find if a number is even or odd
- [Question 4](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/tree/master/Assignment_2/Question_4) - Write a program that inputs three different integers from the keyboard, then prints the sum, the averages, the product, the smallest and the largest of these numbers. Use only single selection form of the if statement.
