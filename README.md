For example, the square matrix array is shown below:
1 2 3
4 5 6

- [Question 17](https://github.com/Chikoness/UTMSPACE_1819_ProgrammingTechniques1/blob/master/Extra_Assignment/Code_17.c) - HackerLand University has the following grading policy: Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100; Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade. Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules: If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5; If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade. For example, grade = 84 will be rounded to 85 but grade = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40. Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.
